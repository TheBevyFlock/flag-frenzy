# Installation

`flag-frenzy` is primarily geared towards testing Bevy using Github Actions. Because of this, it does not have version numbers or changelogs, and it is not published on <https://crates.io>. You must install it from the repository instead:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/TheBevyFlock/flag-frenzy.git
```

To ensure that it installed, try running it:

```bash
flag-frenzy --help
```
